# Reasearch-Project-Signal-Processing



**script 1** : bandpass.py 
n prior work with the MIT dataset, bandpass filtering effectively classified and filtered EEG signals into relevant frequency bands, successfully isolating rhythmic activity from noise. That method helped separate neural oscillations by frequency ranges and remove irrelevant components.


**script 2** : bandpass2.py 
This method presents an innovative approach to EEG signal analysis applied to the dataset "EEG_Cat_Study4_II_II_S1.bdf". Building upon previous success with the MIT dataset (chb17b_68.edf) in classifying and filtering uneven frequency components, this work focuses on spike identification as a new challenge.
