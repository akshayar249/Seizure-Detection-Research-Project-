You decide by **testing the model** and seeing how well it performs.

## üí° Why You Can‚Äôt Judge Just from Bar Plots:

Bar plots of mean/std/skew/kurtosis:

* Show basic **variation** across channels
* Help **visually confirm** that features aren‚Äôt constant (i.e., they carry information)
* But they **don‚Äôt reveal** if those features are *enough* for accurate classification

> You could have beautiful, varied bar plots ‚Äî and still poor model performance.

---

## ‚úÖ How to Actually Decide:

1. **Extract baseline time-domain features** (mean, std, skew, kurtosis)
2. **Train a simple model** (e.g., RandomForest, LogisticRegression)
3. **Evaluate performance** (accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix)

### If performance is low:

‚û°Ô∏è **Add more features** (RMS, zero-crossing rate, entropy, Hjorth parameters, etc.)
‚û°Ô∏è Retrain and re-evaluate

## ‚úÖ So What Do Bar Plots Help With?

* Spot **weird outliers** or faulty signals
* Confirm features differ across samples or channels
* But **they are not a performance indicator**


## ‚úÖ Option 1: Unsupervised Learning

Since you don‚Äôt have labels, you can:

* **Extract features** (mean, std, skew, kurtosis, etc.)
* Then use clustering (like **KMeans**, **DBSCAN**) to find **natural groups** in the data
* Afterwards, **inspect the clusters** to see if some look like seizures (based on amplitude, entropy, etc.)

> Useful if you suspect there *are* patterns like seizures but no labels are given.

---

## ‚úÖ Option 2: Add Labels (if you can)

Ask yourself:

* Can you get **manual annotations** from someone (e.g., neurologist or EEG tool)?
* Is this dataset from somewhere that provides **labels in a separate file**?

If yes ‚Üí you can join the labels and do supervised learning (ideal).

---

## ‚úÖ Option 3: Feature Exploration Only

If your goal is just to:

* Explore EEG signals
* Understand variability across time/channels
* Extract meaningful features

Then you're doing exactly what's needed: extract time-domain features, visualize them, maybe reduce dimensionality (PCA), or cluster them.

---

## üîç Summary

Without labels:

* You **cannot** train a seizure-detection classifier.
* But you **can** extract features and cluster/analyze them.
* Or you can look for ways to **get/derive labels** if your goal is classification.
